# MartianChornicles

This is a small project of mine created using PyQt and NASA api

## Functionalities

Retrives images according to the camera, rover and date inputs given <br>
Diplays the image in the inbuilt image viewer<br>
Sends emails to multiple recipients with the fetched images as attachments.

## Bugs?

Cannot make the window smaller after maximizing due to the image label not allowing to be rescaled to a smaller size
